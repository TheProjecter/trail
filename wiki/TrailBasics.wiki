= The Zen art of the 4 letter conventions =

Trail URLs conventions are based on a pair of action and content separated by an   * underscore, all actions and content types names are four letter english words. For example, the endpoints for the basic CRUD operations regarding blog posts (rants) would look like:

{{{
/blog/born_rant
/blog/view_rant
/blog/edit_rant
/blog/done_rant
/blog/kill_rant
}}}

== Content types / Models ==
  * user - a user profile representation (for authors and commenteers)
  * site - a website profile (similar to user but for trackbacks/pingbacks)
  * rant - a blog post entry
  * note - a comment on a rant
  * mark - a label to classify other contents (tag)
  * icon - an image representing a category


== Current 4 letter Actions ==
  * born
  * view
  * done
  * edit
  * save
  * hide
  * kill
  * rate
  * hate
  * love
  * list
  * ping
