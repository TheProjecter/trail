This is a blogging web application that covers the basic blogging needs, with good defaults and no bloat.

The current version is written mostly in PHP and requires a server that implements the Ning Content Store and the Ning REST APIs to be installed (Ning.com for example).

DISCLAIMER
This software was developed with the sole purpose of publishing the personal blog of Fabricio Zuardi, this is not a general purpose blog platform in any ways. But the code is open and if you find that it might be useful for you use at your own risk.

Feel free to contribute with the project with patches and bug reports, but do not expect any email replies or support of any kind whatsoever :)
